# dsh-usage-panel

Token usage statistics for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness), shown as a page under **Settings → Usage** in the web GUI. The plugin aggregates persisted session logs (incrementally, via the session-projection mechanism) and never writes anything back.

## What it shows

- **Cumulative totals (all time)** — billed input / output tokens, session count (with the grand total of session records and the main/subagent usage split beneath it), and the most-used model with its share.
- **Cache hit rate** — `cache read ÷ (uncached input + cache read + cache write)`, with the read/write magnitudes.
- **Activity heatmap** — the last six months in a GitHub-contribution layout (weeks as columns, weekdays as rows). Days are colored by quartile over non-zero usage.
- **Daily stacked bars** — per-model token usage, switchable between the last 7, 14, or 30 days.
- **Top sessions** — the 10 most token-hungry sessions with their folded titles.
- **Providers** — per-provider totals (shown when more than one provider route is in use).
- **Model donut** — all-time share per model, with the top 5 listed beside it and the rest folded into "other".
- **Export** — full JSON, daily CSV and per-model CSV (formula-injection guarded, RFC 4180, UTF-8 BOM).

Hovering a bar or a donut segment shows the exact breakdown:

## Install

The plugin ships as a bundle: `dsh plugin add` appends it to the profile's bundle list, and the patch row activates the host half.

```sh
# from npm (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-usage-panel

# or from GitHub
dsh plugin --profile web add github:AlfredChaos/dsh-usage-panel

# or from a local checkout
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-usage-panel
```

Restart `dsh --profile web` and open **Settings → Usage**. The npm package ships prebuilt JavaScript under `lib/` with no install scripts; GitHub installs need no pnpm build allowance either, because the same files are committed to the repository. To remove it:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-usage-panel
```

## Where the numbers come from

The host half aggregates persisted session logs:

- **Primary path (incremental)**: a session projection (registered through `ctx.sessionProjections`, `stateVersion`-checked) folds every committed event into four disjoint buckets — uncached input, output, cache read, cache write — plus per-model, per-provider and per-day (UTC) maps. Checkpoints are durable, so restarts and keep-warm passes cost almost no replay.
- **Fallback path (full rescan)**: when the projection services are unavailable, the same reducer replays every session log through the read-only `sessionQuery` service.

Accounting rules: `request/header` and `request/context` events record the model (context base, header override); the step's `assistant/message` usage replaces streamed provisional usage (a retried same-step message never double-counts); `llm/retry` events are counted as retries, not tokens; `compaction/summary` usage is attributed to its own model and reported separately; reasoning tokens are already inside output and are never added again.

**Fork dedup**: events that precede the last `session/end-seed` marker (fork/resume/replay seed history) are never counted, so forked sessions do not double-bill their parents' usage.

**Timezone declaration**: day buckets and exports use **UTC** calendar days (`YYYY-MM-DD`); the panel declares this scope ("local session logs only, UTC").

Because nothing is written back, statistics survive restarts and cover sessions from before the plugin was installed.

## Loading behavior

The first scan starts as soon as the plugin loads, so the page usually renders straight from cache. A payload is considered fresh for 10 minutes; older ones are returned immediately with a `stale` flag (the page shows "updating in background") while a rescan refreshes the cache. A keep-warm timer rescans every 10 minutes, and the refresh button always forces a synchronous scan. The browser additionally keeps the last successful payload in `localStorage` (versioned and structure-validated), so a page refresh renders instantly; a failed refresh keeps the cached numbers and says so instead of faking freshness.

## Units

zh interface: `亿` (10⁸) and `万` (10⁴); en interface: K / M / B.

## Implementation

Source is TypeScript (strict) in `src/`, built with esbuild; the `lib/` outputs are committed so installs need no build step.

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/host/index.ts` → `lib/index.js` | Host half (Cordis plugin): projection registration, aggregation, cached RPC with warm-up, fail-soft fallback |
| `src/host/projection.ts` | Pure per-session projection reducer (four buckets, fork dedup, retry/compaction semantics, UTC days) |
| `src/host/aggregate.ts` | Cross-session merge → overview payload |
| `src/client/*` → `lib/client.js` | Client half (`./client` export, `__ModuleLoader__` bundle): settings-page UI in TSX, `--dsw-*` tokens, zh/en i18n |
| `src/shared/contract.ts` | Host↔client wire contract (single source of truth) |
| `cordis.patch.yml` | Bundle patch: inserts the `usage-stats` row into the profile composition |

The host serves an `overview` endpoint through `ctx.connection.rpc.handle('/usage-stats', …, { authority: 'loopback' })`; the browser calls it via `rpc.call('/usage-stats', 'overview', …)`. The overview carries `coverage` (sessions scanned/failed/pending, mode, UTC declaration, event range), `topSessions`, `providers`, plus the v0.1.0-shaped `days` / `totals` / `byModel` / `allTime`. Developed against DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc.6`. Tests run on the Node built-in test runner (`npm test`); CI runs typecheck + build + test + the pack gate.
